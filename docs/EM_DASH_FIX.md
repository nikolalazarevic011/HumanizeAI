# Em Dash Fix and Quality Improvements

## ðŸ”§ **Fixed Issues:**

### 1. **Em Dash Cleanup**
- **Problem**: Awkward em dashes like "rhythmâ€”often" and "wayâ€”something"
- **Solution**: Added cleanup to replace `wordâ€”word` with `word word`
- **Preserves**: Intentional em dashes in proper punctuation contexts

### 2. **Better Word Protection**
- **Added to protected list**: "expression", "often", "accompanied", "experience", "writing", "performance", "room", "some", "state", "flow"
- **Prevents**: Common words from becoming weird synonyms

### 3. **Enhanced Blacklist**
- **Added bad synonyms**: "oft", "attended", "minimum", "foreclose", "merely", "receive", "functioning", "way", "around", "tell", "humanise", "array", "construction", "originative"
- **Result**: Much better synonym quality

### 4. **More Conservative Replacement**
- **Rate reduced**: From every 3rd word (40%) to every 4th word (30%)
- **Length requirement**: Increased from 3+ to 4+ characters
- **Better quality**: Fewer replacements but much higher quality

## âœ… **Expected Improvements:**

**Before fix:**
```
Vibe coding is about tapping into a state of rhythm and enjoymentâ€”often attended by music, minimum distractions, and aesthetic setups.
```

**After fix:**
```
Vibe coding is about tapping into a state of rhythm and enjoyment often accompanied by music, minimal distractions, and aesthetic setups.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Changes:**

1. **Em dashes cleaned up**: No more awkward `wordâ€”word` patterns
2. **Better synonyms**: Protected important words from bad replacements  
3. **Quality over quantity**: Fewer but much better word replacements
4. **Natural flow**: Text reads much more naturally while still avoiding AI detection

The system now produces high-quality, readable text that eliminates AI patterns without the awkward artifacts!
