# Overview  
This product is a web application that allows users to paste blocks of AI-generated text and receive a humanized version. The goal is to transform AI-generated content so that it appears to be written by a human, making it less likely to be detected by online AI detectors. The app is valuable for users who need their content to pass as human-written for academic, professional, or creative purposes.

# Core Features  
- **Text Input & Output:** Users can paste AI-generated text and receive a humanized version.
- **Humanization Engine:** Advanced algorithms and models to rewrite text in a more human-like style.
- **AI Detector Feedback:** Optionally, show a score or feedback on how detectable the text is as AI-generated (using third-party APIs or open-source models).
- **User Interface:** Simple, intuitive UI for pasting, editing, and copying text.
- **Privacy & Security:** Ensure user data is not stored or misused.

# User Experience  
- **User personas:**
  - Content creators needing undetectable text
  - Students and academics
  - Professionals preparing reports or emails
- **Key user flows:**
  - User visits the site, pastes AI-generated text, clicks "Humanize", and receives the output.
  - User optionally checks the detectability score and iterates if needed.
  - User copies the humanized text for use elsewhere.
- **UI/UX considerations:**
  - Minimalist, distraction-free interface
  - Clear feedback and error handling
  - Mobile and desktop responsive design

# Technical Architecture  
- **Frontend:** React (or similar) SPA for user interaction
- **Backend:** Node.js/Python API to process and humanize text
- **Humanization Engine:** Custom or fine-tuned LLM, or prompt engineering with existing LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Claude)
- **AI Detector Integration:** Use APIs or open-source models to provide feedback on detectability
- **Infrastructure:** Cloud hosting (e.g., Vercel, AWS, GCP), secure API endpoints, rate limiting

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP requirements:**
  - Paste text, humanize, and copy output
  - Basic UI/UX
  - Simple backend with LLM integration
  - Privacy policy and basic security
- **Future enhancements:**
  - AI detector feedback integration
  - User accounts and history
  - Adjustable humanization levels
  - Support for multiple languages
  - API access for programmatic use

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Build backend humanization API first (foundation)
- Develop frontend to interact with API
- Integrate LLM for text rewriting
- Add AI detector feedback (optional, after MVP)
- Enhance UI/UX and add advanced features

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical challenges:** Ensuring high-quality, undetectable humanization; may require model fine-tuning or prompt engineering
- **MVP definition:** Focus on core flow (paste, humanize, copy) before adding extras
- **Resource constraints:** Use third-party APIs initially to reduce development time; plan for scaling as usage grows
